# Invokes a forked version of typescript-language-server
# (https://github.com/harto/typescript-language-server/tree/remove-hardcoded-timeouts)
#
# The fork has been patched to remove timeouts, because we seem to hit those
# when working in large codebases, and they crash the server.
#
# This whole situation can be removed:
#  - if/when timeouts are removed upstream
#  - if/when our codebase stops causing timeouts
#
# See:
#  - https://github.com/theia-ide/typescript-language-server/pull/92
